# Markdown Previewer
This project was inspired by one of the freeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries Projects.

## Brief description

In the app I use React on the front end. The app contains editor, where you can write text in markdown and a previewer, where markdown text is interpreted and displayed.

## Setup

You can run the project, by a command:

`run npm i && npm start`

and then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Live

Or you can just preview it under this link: (https://papi-markdown-previewer.netlify.app/).
